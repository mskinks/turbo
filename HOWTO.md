# Turbo

F-Chat web client that goes vroom.

## Features

  * Fast like a desktop app, but works in your browser.
  * Full keyboard control-- you never need to take your fingers off the keyboard while you chat! Not even to click a link.
  * Split Screen: watch and chat in 2 channels side by side at the same time if you've got one of them big-ass monitors.
  * Built for power users: typeahead channel search, a detailed LFRP adblocker and powerful log management and download (no more saving your logs-- Turbo can keep them for you in its own local log database).
  * All in your own browser: nothing is stored in any cloud services; it's all local and private even though you're chatting from a web client.

## Requirements

Turbo uses a lot of the newest Web technology to make all of this work. That means you'll need a reasonably modern browser to use it. Firefox or Chrome work best, since they are usually the most up-to-date. On Safari and Internet Explorer (10 or newer), chatting should work fine, but log management may be buggy.

Other than a recent non-buggy browser, you don't need anything! If you don't have one of those, please use the (slower) official F-List web chat slient instead. Turbo is built for speed, and trying to support old browsers slows it down.

## The Action Pad

After logging in, you'll soon notice that a white dropdown thing with a search box keeps popping up most of the time when you click on something. We call that the Action Pad, and you can perform pretty much any command using it, so you never need to reach for the mouse. Really handy when chatting!

When you pop up the Action Pad, it will display a list of sensible things you can do from where you are right now (i.e., in a channel, it will offer to modify your channel settings, or go through the characters in that channel). Just start typing parts of commands or names, and the list will narrow down to what you're typing. You can select a command from the list with arrow keys and Enter or a mouse click (or tap on tablets).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Here's how to get around Turbo quickly:

| **Where** | **Key Combo** | **Does What** |
|---|---|---|
| Anywhere | `Ctrl-Space` | Action Pad for switching between tabs, joining channels, opening PMs to characters, and other general stuff. |
| Anywhere | `Ctrl-Up` and `Ctrl-Down` | Switch between tabs in the tab bar. |
| Channel | `Ctrl-C` | Action Pad: channel options and the channel's character list. |
| PM | `Ctrl-C` | Action Pad: character actions for your PM partner (ignore, open profile, etc.) |
| Channel + PM | `Ctrl-O` | Action Pad: view recently posted links and open them via keyboard. |
| Channel + PM | `Ctrl-S` | Split Screen: pop this channel out to the split pane. If another channel is already popped out, switch them. If you press `Ctrl-S` while on the split pane, it will pop back in. |
| Anywhere | `Ctrl-Left`, `Ctrl-Right` | Move between split pane and tab pane. |
