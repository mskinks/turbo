            It seems like you're using a script- or adblocker that has blocked Turbo's
            scripts. Turbo needs JavaScript to run. It does not load any third party
            scripts or libraries apart from a couple fonts, so it's safe to allow
            (as long as you trust Turbo's own code anyway).

            If you'd like to check out Turbo's source code to be extra sure,
            you can do that <a href="https://github.com/mskinks/turbo" target="_blank">on github</a>.
